# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 4, 2025

## Our Commitment to Privacy

At bloat-free.com, we believe in transparency and respecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Information We Collect

### Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics 4 to understand how visitors use our website. This helps us improve our content and user experience.

**What Google Analytics collects:**
- Pages you visit and time spent on each page
- Your general location (country/region, not specific address)
- Device and browser information
- How you arrived at our site (referrer)
- Anonymous usage patterns

**Privacy protections we've implemented:**
- **IP Anonymization**: Your IP address is anonymized
- **No Advertising Features**: We don't use data for ad targeting
- **Respect Do Not Track**: We honor your browser's Do Not Track setting
- **Short Cookie Duration**: Analytics cookies expire in 1 day (not 2 years)
- **No Personal Data**: We don't collect names, emails, or personal information

## Do Not Track

If you have "Do Not Track" enabled in your browser, we will not load Google Analytics at all. Your privacy preference is respected.

## How to Opt Out

### Disable Analytics Completely
Enable "Do Not Track" in your browser settings:
- **Chrome**: Settings → Privacy and Security → Send a "Do Not Track" request
- **Firefox**: Settings → Privacy & Security → Send websites a "Do Not Track" request
- **Safari**: Preferences → Privacy → Ask websites not to track me

### Block Analytics Scripts
You can also use browser extensions like uBlock Origin or Ghostery to block analytics scripts.

## Data Retention

- **Google Analytics**: Data is retained according to Google's default retention policies

## Third-Party Services

We only use Google Analytics. We don't use:
- Social media tracking pixels
- Advertisement networks
- Email marketing trackers
- Heat mapping tools
- Other analytics services

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "last updated" date.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at [your-contact-email].

## Technical Implementation

For transparency, here's what we've implemented:

```javascript
// Example: How we respect Do Not Track
if (navigator.doNotTrack === "1") {
    console.log("Google Analytics disabled due to Do Not Track setting");
    // Analytics is not loaded
}
```

We believe in being completely transparent about our data practices. If you have questions about any technical aspect of our privacy implementation, please don't hesitate to ask.
